PathEditor
-----------

An old-school WinForms application that allows viewing and modifying the strings in the Windows `PATH` environment variable. 

Requires elevated permissions to modify the machine-wide variable store. User-wide PATH can be edited normally.

Uses 2 icons from the Visual Studio 2013 Image Library pack.
